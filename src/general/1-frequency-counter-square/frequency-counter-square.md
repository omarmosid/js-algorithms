## Problem
Given two arrays of integers A and B, check to see if B is square of A.

## Note
- Order of elements does not matter
- Duplicate elements should have corresponding duplicate square values

## Example:
Given `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [9, 1, 4]` should return `true`

Given `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [9, 1]` should return `false` 

Given `A = [1, 2, 3, 2]` and `B = [9, 1, 4, 4]` should return `true`
